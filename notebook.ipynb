Butter Chicken: Instead of chicken, you can use paneer (Indian cottage cheese) or tofu as a protein substitute. Marinate the paneer or tofu in a mixture of yogurt and spices before cooking it in the buttery tomato sauce.\\n\\n2. Chana Masala: To make this chickpea curry even more flavorful, you can add roasted vegetables like sweet potatoes or butternut squash. They will add a hint of sweetness and depth to the dish.\\n\\n3. Palak Paneer: For a vegan version of this dish, you can replace paneer with firm tofu or even boiled and cubed potatoes. The creamy spinach curry will still be delicious and nutritious.\\n\\n4. Biryani: Instead of meat, you can use a variety of vegetables like carrots, peas, bell peppers, and potatoes to make a flavorful vegetable biryani. Make sure to layer the rice and vegetables with fragrant spices for an aromatic dish.\\n\\n5. Aloo Gobi: This dish is already vegetarian, but you can make it vegan by skipping the ghee and using oil for cooking. You can also add some green peas or bell peppers for extra color and flavor.\\n\\n6. Dal Tadka: To make this lentil curry even more nutritious, you can add leafy greens like spinach or kale. They will wilt into the curry and add a pop of color and freshness.\\n\\nThese alternatives will help you create delicious vegetarian versions of these classic Indian dishes while staying true to their traditional flavors.
